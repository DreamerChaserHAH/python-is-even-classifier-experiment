# Is Even Neural Network Classifier

> An experiment to see how NN can approach this simple issue of binary classification

Checking whether if a number is even or odd can easily be done using normal coding techniques, but I realized there are some catches to be careful about when trying to train a model to do this for us

```
src/
    dataset.cpp <- generate data set
    training.py <- train the model
    usage.py <- using after being trained
```
